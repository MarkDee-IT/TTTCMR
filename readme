This is a Short Desciption of the Code
########################################
The necessary libraries are introduced at the start, one for the LEDs and the other for the RTC.

After that three variables are created for the purpose of splitting the tens from the minutes and 
hours, and the latter is used for incramenting seconds.

Using a For loop, digital pin 1-13 is initialised and then we begin the RTC and wiring to allow it to send Information.

Using the DateTime method we create a variable called now whick will get the current time form the rtc and then
using now.second, now.minute and now.hour, we give them values.

And lastly the main part of the program which allows time to flow, Millis(), instead of constantly getting the time from the RTC,
we use a counter which incraments when 1000ms passes since the last tick, millis counts from the beginning of the proram without interupptions
which can be used as a counter if we constantly have it check if 1000ms has passed since the last time we incramented.

The rest of the code is self explanatory and can be understood, using CurMin and CurHour, i split the time by leaving only the right side.
Eg: if mins is 47, CurMin is 7.

After splitting them up we use a series of if statements to get the binary of each number.
